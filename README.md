# Customer-Personality-Analysis
I conducted customer analysis through clustering techniques to identify and target interested segments. After feature engineering, which improved the clustering, I ended up with 5 clusters labeled 0 to 4. Clusters 3,4 tend to earn more income, make more purchases, and spend more money. Clusters 3,4 contains people who are not parents. Clusters 0,2 contains people who are parents. Cluster 1 is more of a mix of parents and non-parents relative to the other clusters. About 68% of people in cluster 1 are parents. There is a big split on education as well. Clusters 0,3 contain graduates. Clusters 2,4 contain postgraduates. Cluster 1 contains undergraduates.
